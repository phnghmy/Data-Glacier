Logistic Regression: Baseline model for interpretability and key feature identification.\n2. Random Forest Classifier: To capture complex feature interactions and non-linear relationships.\n3. XGBoost or LightGBM: High performance on tabular data, handles imbalanced datasets well.\n4. Neural Networks: For capturing intricate patterns and deep feature interactions.\n\nModel Development Strategy:\n- Address class imbalance using SMOTE\n- Perform feature selection based on importance scores\n- Use cross-validation for robust performance estimation\n- Optimize hyperparameters using grid search or Bayesian optimization\n- Evaluate models using AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F1-score\n- Interpret model results using SHAP values for actionable insights","metadata":{}}]}
